# Projects of digital image processing course
In 2020, I am studying digital image processing. These are some small projects that I did. 

( Matlab uses 2019a version, some functions are not compatible with the old version. At present, it is determined to use the version after 2016b as much as possible )

### 1. Sheet music segmentation
